# Spotify Integration Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Spotify API Endpoints

**Added new authenticated endpoints in `spotify/api/endpoints.py`:**
- `/api/spotify/auth/profile` - Get authenticated user's Spotify profile
- `/api/spotify/auth/top-tracks` - Get user's top tracks  
- `/api/spotify/auth/playlists` - Get user's playlists
- `/api/spotify/auth/currently-playing` - Get currently playing track

**Added convenience endpoints:**
- `/api/spotify/u/{spotify_id}` - Alias for public profile lookup
- `/api/spotify/users` - List all users with linked accounts
- `/api/spotify/search-users` - Search for users (alias for existing endpoint)

### 2. Improved Authentication Service

**Updated `next-rusty-tech/src/services/authenticatedSpotifyService.ts`:**
- Integrated with AuthContext for proper token management
- Added missing methods: `getTopArtists()`, `getRecentlyPlayed()`, `getSavedTracks()`
- Improved error handling with better error message extraction
- Removed hardcoded token logic in favor of AuthContext integration

### 3. Refactored Main Dashboard

**Enhanced `SpotifyDashboard.tsx` to act as the main profile page:**
- Added top artists display
- Added recently played tracks
- Improved layout with responsive grid (3 columns on large screens)
- Enhanced error handling and loading states
- Better data structure handling for Spotify API responses
- Cleaner, more comprehensive profile view

### 4. Simplified Main Spotify Page

**Updated `next-rusty-tech/src/app/spotify/page.tsx`:**
- Removed redundant data fetching logic
- Simplified to use SpotifyDashboard as the main component
- Kept optional components (search, connection test) for debugging
- Cleaner authentication flow

## Architecture Overview

```
Next.js App (localhost:3000)
    ↓ (Supabase JWT Token)
Gatekeeper (localhost:8000)
    ↓ (User headers: x-user-id, x-user-email)
Spotify API (localhost:5000)
    ↓ (Spotify OAuth tokens)
Spotify Web API
```

## Components Structure

### Main Components (Keep)
- `SpotifyDashboard` - Main profile dashboard (enhanced)
- `SpotifyLayout` - Layout wrapper for Spotify pages
- `SpotifySearch` - User search functionality
- `SpotifyUserProfile` - Public user profile viewer
- `SpotifyConnectionTest` - Debug/testing component

### Redundant Components (Can Remove)
- `SpotifyDashboardSafe` - Duplicate of SpotifyDashboard
  - Location: `next-rusty-tech/src/components/SpotifyDashboardSafe.tsx`
  - Safe to delete - no other components reference it

## API Endpoints Mapping

### Authenticated User Data (requires login)
- Profile: `GET /api/spotify/auth/profile`
- Top tracks: `GET /api/spotify/auth/top-tracks`
- Top artists: `GET /api/spotify/my/top-artists`
- Playlists: `GET /api/spotify/auth/playlists`
- Currently playing: `GET /api/spotify/auth/currently-playing`
- Recently played: `GET /api/spotify/my/recently-played`
- Saved tracks: `GET /api/spotify/my/saved-tracks`

### Public Data (no auth required)
- User search: `GET /api/spotify/search-users?q=query`
- List users: `GET /api/spotify/users`
- Public profile: `GET /api/spotify/u/{spotify_id}`

## Key Features

### 1. Dashboard as Profile Page
The main Spotify dashboard now serves as the user's profile page, displaying:
- User's Spotify profile information
- Currently playing track (if any)
- Top tracks and artists
- User's playlists
- Recently played tracks

### 2. Proper Error Handling
- Clear error messages for common issues
- Spotify account linking UI when not connected
- Loading states for all async operations

### 3. Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Adaptive grid system (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop)
- Proper image handling with fallbacks

### 4. Integration with Authentication
- Uses AuthContext for token management
- Proper user session handling
- Fallback to login prompt when not authenticated

## Next Steps

1. **Remove redundant component:**
   ```bash
   rm next-rusty-tech/src/components/SpotifyDashboardSafe.tsx
   ```

2. **Test the integration:**
   - Ensure gatekeeper is running (port 8000)
   - Ensure Spotify API is running (port 5000)
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test Spotify account linking

3. **Optional enhancements:**
   - Add music playback controls (if needed)
   - Add playlist management features
   - Add social features for sharing music
   - Add recommendations based on listening history

## Configuration

Make sure these environment variables are set:

**Gatekeeper (.env):**
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**Spotify App (.env):**
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
```

**Next.js App (.env.local):**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEKEEPER_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
